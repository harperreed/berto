# Berto Profile

The Berto Profile driver is used to define a user on your system. The user can then be allowed to connect to your system using any [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net) client.

Users can also setup a pin code which is used by the [Berto Pushover](../../src/Berto_Pushover/README.md) and [Berto IFTTT](../../src/Berto_IFTTT/README.md) drivers to enable a message to be sent to the user when received by Pushover or IFTTT. When a message is received the MESSAGE_RECEIVED event is fired which can be used in programming.


## Properties

* Name - Name of user.
* Email Address - Email address of user.
* Remote Access - Enable or Disable Remote Access. 
* Pin Code - Pin code used for accepting messages.
* Received - Type of message last received.
* Title - Title last received.
* Message - Message last received.
* URL - URL last received.
* Status - Reserved for future use.
* Location - Reserved for future use.

When the user is first enabled for Remote Access an OpenVPN client configuration is created using the name you have specifed for the driver in your project. Once the configuration is created it is copied to the /tmp directory on your master controller. The configration is called "Username.ovpn" and needs to be copied from the controller and imported into your OpenVPN client software. 

Subsequently disabling the user does not revoke the configutration but just disables access for the user until you re-enable it again.

When a users details are changed you will need to Refresh Navigators to ensure other Berto drivers receive the profile chnages.
